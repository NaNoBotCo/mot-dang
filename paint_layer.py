"""paint_layer.py — "colour by", for /map.html. WO-79.

WHAT THIS IS
------------
Today the explore map has three colours and they all mean the same kind of
thing: shelf ink says which shelf, the green ring says known-open, the stack
ring says how many share the pin. Nothing on the map is ever coloured by an
attribute of the PLACE. This adds that one control, and nothing else.

THE HOUSE RULE IT KEEPS
-----------------------
The control IS the legend. A shelf chip on /map.html already carries, in its
own swatch, the ink its dots will be drawn in — so the chip row and the map
are one legend and there is no key to look up. A colour-by control that did
not do the same would be the first control on this map that made the reader
remember what a colour meant.

So every option here wears its inks. Two carriers, because one of them is not
reliable:

  · each <option> gets an inline background of its dimension's first ink.
    Firefox and Chrome-on-Android honour that; Safari and Chrome-on-macOS
    paint the native menu themselves and ignore it. UNVERIFIED HERE — I have
    no browser on this machine to measure it in, so it is written as a free
    win where it lands and never as the thing that carries the meaning.
  · the strip under the bar, which is drawn in our own HTML and therefore
    always renders: one swatch per bucket, its words, and its count in view.
    That strip is the legend, and it is also how the reader learns that
    "no hours posted" is 93.6% of the map.

A NEW DIMENSION IS DATA, NOT A MODULE
-------------------------------------
`DIMENSIONS` below is the whole thing: {key, label_th, label_en, kind, values}.
`kind` is 'ramp' or 'categorical'. A row whose `needs` is unsatisfied is
DORMANT — it is not rendered, and `needs` names the exact data change that
wakes it. Nothing else in this file knows the name of any dimension.

WHAT ACTUALLY RIDES IN THE PUBLISHED GeoJSON — measured 2026-09-08 over all
28 files in docs/data/, 63,249 features:

    id  name  nameTh  nameEn  cat  province  slug  rank   63,249 (all)
    k   (stack size, only where >1)                        5,140
    t   (tradeTags, only where the record has any)         2,599   4.1%

  · `rank` is there, 1..7 observed (the scale is 0..9; nothing on this site
    has yet earned 8 or 9). The ramp's domain stays 0..9 because an ant rank
    is an absolute count of facts held, not a rank within the shelf — 4 ants
    must mean the same thing on the food shelf and the temple shelf. The
    legend prints the observed range beside it so the reader is not told the
    map holds a 9 that does not exist.
  · `t` IS present, on 4.1% of features. This CORRECTS the maps-grow note
    §5 and the WO-79 brief, both of which say tags do not ride yet: WO-77 §3
    put them in. What blocks a tag dimension is therefore coverage, not
    schema — see DIMENSIONS['tag'].needs.
  · openness rides in NOTHING. It comes from data/open_lamps.json, which
    explore.js already fetches for the green ring.
  · tambon rides in nothing. `attrs.tambon` is on 3,862 of the first 4,000
    canonical records but geojson() does not copy it out.

COLOUR VISION — MEASURED, NOT ASSERTED
--------------------------------------
`cvd_report()` at the bottom of this file simulates protanopia and
deuteranopia on any set of hexes under two independent models (Viénot,
Brettel & Mollon 1999; Machado, Oliveira & Fernandes 2009 at severity 1.0),
and reports the smallest CIEDE2000 distance it finds. Run it:

    python3 paint_layer.py

The answer for the six shipping inks, 2026-09-08: THEY DO NOT SURVIVE.
Worst pair is ant red #C2401C against amber #B06A00, which falls from
ΔE00 19.22 in normal vision to 3.81 (Viénot) / 4.10 (Machado) under
deuteranopia. Two more pairs are close behind. The numbers, what they cost,
and the options are in notes/maps-grow-2026-09-08.txt §11 — this file does
not change INKS, because which six inks the site paints in is Nan's.

Nothing in here runs a build, and nothing in here fetches anything.

# it at 1.0–1.2:1 — and a ramp needs a pale end or it is not a ramp. The site
# already answered this and the answer is not colour: every dot on the
# explore map is drawn over a `-halo` circle of #FFFCF6 at 0.85, one to two
# pixels wider than the dot (explore_layer.addLayer). That white coat is what
# separates a dot from whatever it is standing on. maps-gemba §2e says it
# outright — "pins keep their dominance by halo rather than by the map
# staying pale".
#
# So the gate is contrast against PAPER, at the WCAG 3:1 floor for meaningful
# graphics. Casing and water are MEASURED AND PRINTED, never gated, because
# gating on them would forbid every pale ink and there would be no ramp.

# records the published GeoJSON carries, 3,968 have hours on record and

# businesses that none of them made.
#

#                            shut at 3 a.m. is not a problem, and red on this
#                            site means the ant.
