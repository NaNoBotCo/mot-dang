"""🔌 The public API — the baked half.

The site has published its whole corpus for as long as it has existed:
places.json, a .json beside every place page, per-category GeoJSON, llms.txt.
All of it was reachable only by something that could make a server-side
request, because no response carried an Access-Control-Allow-Origin, and all
of it was whole-file, because there was nothing to ask a question of. So the
licence said "reuse it, train on it, quote it" and a person who wanted the
clinics open right now within two kilometres had to download twenty-five
megabytes and write the filter themselves. That is a dump, not an API.

This module bakes the four files that turn it into one:

    docs/api/v1/index.json    the query index the Worker holds in memory
    docs/api/v1/schema.json   the frozen key contract, generated not written
    docs/api/v1/openapi.json  the spec, generated from the same lists
    docs/api/index.html       the page a person reads
    docs/terms.html           the terms: take it, credit us, that is all

The query logic itself is publish/api.js — it runs at the edge, not here.

WHY THE INDEX IS A BAKED FILE
-----------------------------
No database. The Worker already had an R2 binding and nothing else, and the
corpus changes once per build, so a file the isolate parses once and answers
thousands of requests from is both the simplest thing and the fastest. A D1
table would add a binding, a migration, a second source of truth, and a way
for a field to mean one thing on a page and another in the API. This cannot
drift that way: it is written by the build that writes the pages, in the same
pass, from the same records, through the same helpers. And it carries EVERY
record — see the "nothing is filtered out" note in build_index() for why an
invisible filter is the one thing an API must not do to a caller.

THE THREE CONVENTIONS, CARRIED INTO THE JSON
--------------------------------------------
1. Absence is absence. A place whose hours nobody holds is absent from the
   schedule table, and the API answers `openNow: null` for it — never false.
   A place with no pin has no lat/lng and drops out of a near= query rather
   than being placed somewhere plausible.
2. Provenance travels. Every row says its confidence and whether it is
   OSM-derived, because the second one decides which licence the reader is
   standing under and they cannot be expected to guess.
3. Keys are a promise. v1's response keys are frozen and locked by
   tests/test_api.py. They may be added to. They are never removed, renamed
   or retyped; that is what v2 is for.

Entry point:
    emit(g, data, photos, tags)   after the lens layer, before the sitemap
