/* mot-dang public API — the query engine, with nothing platform-specific in it.
 *
 * WHY IT IS ITS OWN FILE
 * ----------------------
 * worker.js is routing, R2 and headers; this is the part that has opinions
 * about what a query MEANS. Splitting them lets tests/test_api_worker.js run
 * the whole filter/sort/page path under plain node against the real
 * docs/api/v1/index.json, with no Cloudflare and no network. A query rule that
 * cannot be tested without deploying is a rule nobody checks.
 *
 * WHAT THE ENGINE PROMISES
 * ------------------------
 * The house rule about absence holds all the way into the JSON: a place whose
 * hours we do not hold is `openNow: null`, never `false`, and `open_now=1`
 * excludes it rather than calling it shut. Same for coordinates — a record
 * with `geoPrecision: "needs-pin"` has no lat/lng and simply cannot answer a
 * `near=` query, so it drops out of that query and stays in every other one.
 * Silence is reported as silence.
 *
 * KEY STABILITY
 * -------------
 * Every key a response carries is frozen for the life of /api/v1/ and locked
 * by tests/test_api.py. Keys may be ADDED to v1; none is ever removed,
 * renamed, or retyped. A change that would break a reader gets /api/v2/ and
 * v1 keeps running beside it. See docs/api/v1/schema.json, which is generated
 * from the same frozen list rather than written by hand.
